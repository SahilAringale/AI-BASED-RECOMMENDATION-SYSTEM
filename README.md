# AI-Based Recommendation System Using Java and Apache Mahout

This project implements a recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout, a powerful machine learning library. The system suggests products or content to users based on their preferences and interactions, making it ideal for applications like e-commerce platforms, movie recommendations, and more.

### Features:
- **User Preferences**: The recommendation system analyzes user preferences based on past interactions and behaviors (e.g., ratings, clicks, purchases) to suggest relevant products or content.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Using Apache Mahout’s collaborative filtering algorithms, the system recommends items based on similar users’ preferences. This allows for personalized recommendations without needing explicit user attributes.
- **Sample Data**: The system includes sample data (user-item ratings or interactions), which can be replaced with real-world data for a more robust and scalable implementation.
- **Flexible & Scalable**: The recommendation engine is designed to handle large datasets and can be extended with more sophisticated algorithms and features.

### How It Works:
1. **Data Input**: The system starts with a dataset of user-item interactions (such as product ratings or content views). This data is used to build a model for generating recommendations.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: The recommendation engine is built using Mahout’s collaborative filtering algorithms, which identify patterns in the data to make recommendations. The system computes similarities between users or items and provides suggestions accordingly.
3. **Recommendation Output**: After processing the data, the system generates a list of recommended items for each user, providing personalized suggestions based on their preferences.
4. **Java Implementation**: The core of the system is built in Java, with Mahout integrated to leverage its machine learning capabilities for efficient recommendation generation.

### Instructions:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Apache Mahout**:
   - Download and set up Apache Mahout as per the official documentation (https://mahout.apache.org/).
3. **Run the Recommendation Engine**:
   - Compile and run the program using the following commands:
     ```
     javac RecommendationSystem.java
     java RecommendationSystem
     ```
4. **Sample Data**:
   - The system includes sample user-item data. You can modify or expand the data to fit your use case.
